## Weekly Challenges & Lessons

Biggest challenge this week:
Filtering relevant OSINT data and validating multiple sources without wasting time.

How you overcame it (or plan to):
Used structured note-taking, cross-verification (reverse image + map validation), and slowed down analysis before confirming answers.

Most valuable lesson learned:
OSINT success depends more on observation and correlation than technical exploitation.

Adjustment for next week:
Increase total training hours to at least 15, introduce Web Exploitation challenges, and attempt at least one Hard-level room.
