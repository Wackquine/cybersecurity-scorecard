For this challenge, we were given a photo of a resort located on an island. The goal was to identify the resort name, the island’s coordinates, and the camera’s facing direction.

Step 1: Reverse Image Search

I started by using the RevEye reverse image search extension. This allowed me to quickly search the image across multiple engines.

One of the results led me to a Facebook page:
https://www.facebook.com/oanresort/photos/

From the photos, I identified that the place in the challenge image matched Oan Resort.

Answer (a):
Oan Resort

Step 2: Finding the Location

After confirming the resort name, I checked the Facebook page for location details. The page indicated where the resort was located.

I then searched for Oan Resort on Google Maps and opened it in Google Earth to get a clearer satellite view. By matching the shoreline, surrounding landscape, and nearby features with the challenge image, I confirmed the exact island.

Answer (b):
Coordinates of the island: 7.36421, 151.75671

Step 3: Determining Camera Direction

Using Google Earth, I adjusted the view to match the angle seen in the original photo. By comparing the coastline shape and nearby land formations, I determined the direction the camera must have been facing.

Based on the positioning of the shoreline and surrounding land, the camera was facing west.

Answer (c):
West

This challenge mainly required reverse image searching, verifying through social media, and using Google Maps/Earth to confirm both location and camera direction.
