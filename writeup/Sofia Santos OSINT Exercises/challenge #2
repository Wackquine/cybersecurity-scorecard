First, I zoomed into the image and searched for the words “Flinders Street Station” that were visible in the photo. That led me to Flinders Street Railway Station in Melbourne, Australia. I opened Google Maps and compared the surroundings, tracks, and nearby buildings with the original image. The layout matched, and after checking similar photos online, I confirmed that the picture was taken at Flinders Street Railway Station, specifically around Platform 5.
  

For the second question, I noticed a tall building in the skyline that did not appear in older Google Street View images, which suggested it was newly built. I used AI to help highlight and isolate the visible buildings in the image so I could focus on identifying the tallest one. Then I searched for the tallest buildings near Flinders Street Station and compared their heights to the Arts Centre Melbourne, which is 162 meters tall and visible in the photo. After checking building information, I found that FOCUS Apartments stands at 167 meters, making it taller than the Arts Centre. This confirms that the building in the image is FOCUS Apartments and that the photo must have been taken after its construction around 2020–2021.
