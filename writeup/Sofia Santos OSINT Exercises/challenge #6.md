In this challenge, we were given a tweet from January 19, 2023 claiming that TTP carried out a suicide attack on a police post in Khyber city, Pakistan, killing three officers. The task was to verify whether the image in the tweet actually showed that event.

Step 1: Reverse Image Search

I used RevEye to perform a reverse image search on the provided photo. The results showed that the image was not recent and had appeared online years before 2023.

One of the matching results was from this article:

Photo: ![](https://github.com/Wackquine/cybersecurity-scorecard/blob/d444077d43a3d0680c815b704403c7c639787029/writeup/Sofia%20Santos%20OSINT%20Exercises/Assets/Exercise%20%236%20Photo's%20Actual%20Incident.png)

This confirmed that the image was from a much older and unrelated incident.

Step 2: Verify the News Event

Next, I searched for credible news sources about the January 19, 2023 attack in Pakistan. I found a Reuters article confirming that the attack did occur:

https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistani-taliban-attacks-police-outpost-killing-three-officers-2023-01-19/
Photo: ![](https://github.com/Wackquine/cybersecurity-scorecard/blob/d444077d43a3d0680c815b704403c7c639787029/writeup/Sofia%20Santos%20OSINT%20Exercises/Assets/Exercise%20%236%20News%20Article%20to%20the%20Incident.png)
  
The Reuters article verified that the attack was real and that three police officers were killed. However, the image used in the viral tweet was not from that event.

Conclusion

The journalist’s statement about the attack was true — the incident did happen. However, the photo shared in the tweet was misleading and taken from a different, older incident.

This challenge highlights the importance of reverse image searching to detect misinformation and reused images in breaking news.
