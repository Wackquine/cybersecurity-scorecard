https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/osint-exercise-005/

For this challenge, we were given a screenshot from a zoo live cam showing polar bears. The image was taken on January 15, 2023 at around 2 PM local time. The task was to identify the zoo, the temperature at that time, and the exact coordinates of where the bears were lying down.

Step 1: Identify the Zoo

I started by using RevEye reverse image search on the screenshot. One of the results led me to an Instagram post:

From that post and related images, I confirmed that the location was the San Diego Zoo.

Answer (a):
San Diego Zoo

Step 2: Find the Temperature

After confirming the zoo, I searched for historical weather data for San Diego Zoo on January 15, 2023. I used this website:

From the historical data for around 2 PM local time, the temperature was 15°C.

Answer (b):
15°C

Step 3: Find the Exact Coordinates

Next, I located a map and infographic of the San Diego Zoo to determine where the polar bear enclosure was located. After identifying the correct zone, I opened Google Maps and then switched to Google Earth for a better satellite view.

I matched the enclosure layout and viewing angle from the screenshot with the satellite imagery. By adjusting the camera angle in Google Earth to replicate the perspective from the live cam, I identified the exact spot where the bears were lying down.

Answer (c):
32.734440128741525, -117.15459515703158

This challenge required reverse image search, historical weather verification, and careful satellite map comparison to determine precise coordinates.
