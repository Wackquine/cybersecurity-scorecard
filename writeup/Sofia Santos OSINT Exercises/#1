From the tweet, we were only given a photo and a short caption. Two key clues stood out: “morning” and “Kiffa.” Since the sun rises in the east, a morning photo suggests the camera was facing south based on the direction of the shadows.



In the image, I noticed buildings on both sides of the road, a tree directly behind the right-side building, and a dry environment with a visible tree line in the distance. There was also a road cutting through the trees and curving slightly right.

I searched for Kiffa on Google Earth and adjusted the map to face south. I looked for an area with dense trees to the south and a road layout matching the image. Eventually, I found a spot near a tree line with buildings positioned similarly to the photo. Historical imagery revealed a “T” shape that likely matches the power lines visible in the original picture.
