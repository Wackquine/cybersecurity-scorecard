Task 2: TIP-OFF
Objective: Identify the attacker’s username.
Since this challenge started with an image, my first instinct was to inspect it carefully. I noticed the file format was SVG, which means it’s text-based. Instead of using typical stego tools, I opened the developer tools (F12) to inspect the source directly.
Inside the SVG code, a directory path immediately stood out. It showed a Linux-style home directory:

/home/XXXX
That directory name revealed the username.

Answer:
Username: SakuraSnowAngelAiko

Task 3: RECONNAISSANCE
Objective: Find the attacker’s email address and full real name.

Now that I had the username, I searched it online. The results showed links pointing to a GitHub account and a LinkedIn profile.
On GitHub, I found a repository related to PGP. That was a strong clue. PGP repositories often contain public keys, which can reveal metadata such as a real name and email address.
I copied the public key and used an online GPG decoder to extract the details.

From the decoded key and LinkedIn profile, I confirmed:

Answer:
Full Name: Aiko Abe
Email: SakuraSnowAngel83@protonmail.com

Task 4: UNVEIL

Objective: Find the attacker’s cryptocurrency wallet address, crypto used, and the mining pool that paid them on January 23, 2021.

The instructions mentioned that the attacker had started deleting information. That meant commit history might contain useful data.
Inside the GitHub repositories tab, I noticed a repository named “ETH.” It only had one line of code, which made it suspicious. After checking the commit history, I found deleted content containing a mining configuration string:
stratum://0xa102397dbeeBeFD8cD2F73A89122fCdB53abB6ef.Aiko:pswd@eu1.ethermine.org:4444

The long hexadecimal string starting with 0xa looked like a wallet address. Searching it led me to a blockchain explorer site where I could view transaction details.

From there, I confirmed:

The wallet address
The cryptocurrency used (Ethereum, plus some Tether transactions)
The mining pool (Ethermine)

Answer:

Wallet Address: 0xa102397dbeeBeFD8cD2F73A89122fCdB53abB6ef
Crypto Used: Ethereum (with some Tether transactions)
Mining Pool (Jan 23, 2021): Ethermine

Task 5: TAUNT

Objective: Find the attacker’s current Twitter handle, the URL where WiFi SSIDs/passwords were saved, and the BSSID of their home WiFi.
We were given an image with a Twitter handle. I searched for it and quickly found updated information.

From the search results:
Twitter Handle: SakuraLoverAiko
Further investigation led to a dark web paste site. After accessing it via Tor Browser, I found a list of WiFi SSIDs and passwords.
To get the BSSID (MAC address), I used WiFi network search tools and searched for the specific SSID listed. The Net ID matched the BSSID required.

Answer:

Twitter Handle: SakuraLoverAiko
Onion URL: depasteon6cqgrykzrgya52xglohg5ovyuyhte3ll7hzix7h5ldfqsyd.onion/show.php?md5=0a5c6e136a98a60b8a21643ce8c15a74
BSSID: 84:AF:EC:34:FC:F8

Task 6: HOMEBOUND

Objective: Identify:
Closest airport before the posted flight photo
Last layover airport
Lake seen on the map
The city the attacker considers home
On Twitter, I found a photo posted before a flight. In the background, I noticed a recognizable monument. A quick visual comparison confirmed it was in Washington, D.C.

The closest airport to that monument is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA).

For the layover image, I used reverse image search tools. The results matched the Japan Airlines Sakura Lounge at Haneda Airport (HND).
The map image showed a lake in Japan. After comparing map shapes and landmarks, it matched Lake Inawashiro.
From earlier WiFi information, the SSID included “HIROSAKI_Free_Wi-Fi,” indicating the home city.

Answer:

Closest Airport: DCA

Layover Airport: HND

Lake: Lake Inawashiro

Home City: Hirosaki
