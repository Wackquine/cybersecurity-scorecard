Step 1: Analyze the Given File

The challenge provided only an image file. Since no other information was given, the first step was to extract the metadata. I used an online Exiftool to analyze the image.

From the metadata, I found useful information in the copyright section. It revealed the username OWoodflint.

Step 2: Investigate the Username

I searched for “OWoodflint” on Google and found a Twitter (X) profile. The profile picture was a cat, which answered the first question.

Q1. What is this user’s avatar of?  
Answer: Cat

Step 3: Check GitHub

Next, I searched for the same username on GitHub. I found the user’s GitHub profile, which contained additional personal information.

From the GitHub profile:
- The city listed was London.
- The personal email address was visible.

Q2. What city is this person in?  
Answer: London  

Q4. What is his personal email address?  
Answer: OWoodflint@gmail.com  

Q5. What site did you find his email address on?  
Answer: GitHub  

Step 4: Investigate the BSSID

On the Twitter profile, the user had posted a WiFi BSSID. Using this information, I went to Wigle.net and performed an advanced search using the BSSID under the Network Characteristics section.

The query returned the associated SSID.

Q3. What is the SSID of the WAP he connected to?  
Answer: UnileverWifi  

Step 5: Check the Blog

I then examined the user’s blog. From the blog posts, I found that he had gone on holiday to New York.

Q6. Where has he gone on holiday?  
Answer: New York  

While inspecting the blog, I viewed the page source code. In the source code, I found a leaked password hidden within the HTML.

Q7. What is the person’s password?  
Answer: pennYDr0pper.!  

Summary

This challenge demonstrated basic OSINT methodology:
- Extract metadata from files
- Investigate usernames across platforms
- Use WiFi lookup tools like Wigle
- Inspect website source code for hidden data

It reinforced the importance of checking metadata, cross-platform searching, and careful inspection of publicly available information.
