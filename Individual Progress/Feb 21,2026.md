### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

I applied a clear OSINT methodology from start to finish. In Challenge #5, I successfully combined reverse image search, historical weather verification, and satellite analysis to pinpoint the exact coordinates at the San Diego Zoo. In Challenge #6, I quickly identified that the viral image was reused from an older incident, showing improvement in detecting misinformation.

**What challenged you?**

Precisely matching the polar bear enclosure’s angle in Google Earth required patience and careful visual comparison. In the misinformation challenge, distinguishing between the truth of the event and the false image required critical thinking to avoid assuming everything in the tweet was fake.

**Key learning:**

Reverse image search is one of the most powerful tools in OSINT, especially for verifying news and detecting reused media. Cross-referencing multiple independent sources (social media, historical weather data, satellite maps, and reputable news outlets) strengthens conclusions and reduces assumptions.

**Tomorrow's focus:**

Practice a timed OSINT challenge to improve speed without sacrificing accuracy, and begin exploring a different category such as Web Exploitation to expand technical depth.
