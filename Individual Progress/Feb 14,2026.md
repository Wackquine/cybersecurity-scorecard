### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

I was able to efficiently use reverse image search and map verification to solve both OSINT exercises. My process was structured and faster compared to previous sessions.

**What challenged you?**

Determining camera direction required careful comparison in Google Earth. I had to double-check angles before confirming.

**Key learning:**

Reverse image search combined with map verification is powerful. Understanding frameworks like the Cyber Kill Chain strengthens defensive thinking.

**Tomorrow's focus:**

Attempt a harder OSINT challenge or move into Web Exploitation to balance offensive and defensive skills.
