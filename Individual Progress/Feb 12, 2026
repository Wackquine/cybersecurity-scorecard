5. Reflection (Qualitative)

What went well today?
I was able to follow the clues step by step and successfully gather the needed information using passive techniques. My analysis process was organized and methodical.

What challenged you?
Some information required deeper searching and connecting multiple sources. It was challenging to filter out unnecessary data and focus only on relevant clues.

Key learning:
OSINT is not about hacking — it’s about careful observation, patience, and connecting small details to form a complete picture.

Tomorrow’s focus:
Improve efficiency in using OSINT tools and practice faster data validation while staying within ethical boundaries.
