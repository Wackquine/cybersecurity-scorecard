### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

I was able to follow the clues step by step and successfully gather the needed information using passive techniques. My analysis process was organized and methodical.

**What challenged you?**

Some information required deeper searching and connecting multiple sources. It was challenging to filter out unnecessary data and focus only on relevant clues.

**Key learning:**

OSINT is not about hacking — it’s about careful observation, patience, and connecting small details to form a complete picture.

**Tomorrow's focus:**

Improve efficiency in using OSINT tools and practice faster data validation while staying within ethical boundaries.
